# northern_democrats

A dataset of Northern Democrats in the House and Senate from approximately 1920 to 1984.
Here, Northern Democrats is calculated by subtracting the number of Democrats in each
formerly Conferederate state from the total number of Democrats in each house of 
Congress.

You are welcome to use either of the following files in any way you wish. I request, but it 
is not required, that if you collect additional data for Congresses not currently represented
in nd congress.xlsx that you similarly share that data. You are welcome to submit
a pull request to this repo in that event.

## nd congress.xlsx

This excel workbook contains four spreadsheets. The first contains the most relevant data:
the number of Northern Democrats in the House and the Senate for each Congress, along with the total size 
of each house of Congress to make calculating percentages easy. The second sheet counts the 
number of Democratic Senators and Congresspeople in each of the former Confederate States.
These numbers are then brought into the third and fourth sheets for the House and Senate
respectively. In each, the number of Democrats, Republics, and other party affiliated
representatives are stored for each Congress. This allows for the subtraction of
Conferederate Democrats from total Democrats, yielding Northern Democrats.

## congresses.xlsx

This is a simple excel spreadsheet with the year from 1900-2014 in one column and the 
corresponding Congress number in the second. This makes merging the nd congresses data
onto yearly data much easier.
